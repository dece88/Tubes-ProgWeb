Synopsis-Emma lives in the Grace Field House, an orphanage, with 38 other children. In the ten years since she’s been there, she’s never had reason to question their quiet everyday lives of being family, the identification numbers on their necks, or the rigorous tests they have to take daily. But the house has mysterious rules, such as being forbidden to go beyond the gates to the outside world, and children leaving once they come of age and are never heard from again. One day, Emma chases after one of those children that leaves...only to discover horrifying monsters and the real reason they’re forbidden to go outside...
