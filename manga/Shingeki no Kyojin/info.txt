Synopsis-Over a century ago, terror rained upon humanity when monstrous giants named “titans” appeared and mercilessly devoured humans. With no other choice, mankind built large walls to barricade themselves safely in and keep the Titans out. Decades later, Eren Yeager is a boy that has grown up within the walls only knowing peace. He and his friends, Mikasa and Armin, innocently dream of exploring the vast world outside the walls. But none except the military have ever left their safe haven, until the day comes when a colossal titan breaks through the wall, and humanity’s peace is shattered to ruins once again.
