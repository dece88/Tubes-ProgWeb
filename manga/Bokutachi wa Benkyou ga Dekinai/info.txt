His headmaster promises that he'll get it if he fullfills a small condition. He has to tutor two resident female geniuses Furuhashi Fumino (Literature genius) and her friend Ogata Rizu (Science genius), so that they can get into their dream college. The catch is that Fumino wants to major in Science and Rizu wants to major in Literature despite them failing constantly in those subjects.
